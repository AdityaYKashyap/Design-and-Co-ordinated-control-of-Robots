# Design-and-Co-ordinated-control-of-Robots
The aim of this project is to design atleast two transport robots to accomplish the task of transporting objects from a given starting position to a given ending position. The robots will be co-ordinated by a central control unit to work efficiently. The emphasis will be on the co-ordination of the robots to accomplish the task and thus the robots used will just be of a prototype scope/complexity. 

This will be used for the documentation of all the stages in the project.
